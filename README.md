# Geo2Vec


## Understanding location

## Goal
The goal of this project is to uncover the latent meaning of location, by creating Geospatial vectors that take into consideration a wide array of different data points(demographic, geographic, psychographic, environmental, temporal), so the resulting embeddings can then be used in a wide array of application. 

It will also be possible for you to access the feature(s) that matter(s) to your specific use case(income, population density, etc)
